# robotics-class
Contains code for robotics class - covers Kalman-Filtering, Leader-Follower formation, Tracjectory Tracking, and SLAM


  This project contains C and matlab code for both implementation and simulation of various topics in Mechatronics.
  
  Code is designed to be implemented on the Pioneer P3-DX which features sonar sensing and has on-board programmable interfaces. Code is also designed for a Roomba which can be run through its serial. Not all code have been imported yet due to not being able to locate files. Topics covered in the projects include Extended Kalman-Filtering, Tracjectory Tracking, and much more.
